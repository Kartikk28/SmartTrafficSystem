# Smart Traffic System ðŸš¦

This project is a simple Smart Traffic System** simulation designed to practice and apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It's a personal project that reflects my journey of experimenting with Java and diving deeper into OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

The project models:
- Traffic Lights that cycle through colors (RED, GREEN, YELLOW) dynamically.
- Intersections that manage multiple traffic lights, allowing them to function cohesively.

### Why I Built This
I've been practicing OOP and wanted to create something practical yet manageable as a way to solidify my understanding of Java. This project helped me:
1. Understand how objects interact with each other in a real-world scenario.
2. Experiment with dynamic behaviors using methods and constructors.
3. Build a foundation for creating more complex systems in the future.

### Key Features
- Dynamic Traffic Light Behavior: Each traffic light cycles its state independently.
- Intersection Management: An intersection manages multiple traffic lights, showcasing object relationships.

### Whatâ€™s Next?
As I continue to grow my skills, I plan to:
- Add features like pedestrian crossing signals or emergency overrides.
- Use this project as a stepping stone to larger, more complex systems.

This is just the beginning of my OOP journey, and Iâ€™m excited to keep learning and building! ðŸ˜Š
